This is the React front-end for the Federated Learning Clinical Safety Server, built with Next.js and Mantine UI.

## Prerequisites

A server running as described in the [dashboard server repository](https://github.com/AlexDobsonPleming/federated-learning-clinical-safety-server).

Before you begin, ensure you have installed:

- Node.js> = 16.8.0
- yarn

---

## Setup & Installation

1. Clone the client repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:AlexDobsonPleming/federated-learning-clinical-safety-client.git
   cd federated-learning-client
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with the following variables:

```dotenv
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
```

Adjust the URL to match your backend deployment.

A sample env file has been provided to match the default settings in the Django backend

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

## Running the Client

Start the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. The client will communicate with the backend via the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` (customise this for your production server).
